# Pico Loader
Pico Loader is a homebrew and retail DS(i) rom loader supporting a variety of platforms (see below).

## Features
- Supports both homebrew and retail DS(i) roms.
- Supports DSiWare and redirects NAND to the flashcard SD card (acting as "emunand", see below for how to setup).
- Supports DS roms with an encrypted secure area.
- Supports a wide range of platforms, including popular flashcards and the DSpico.
- Built-in patches for DS Protect.
- Fast loading.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DSiWare and encrypted DS roms require a DS arm7 bios present at `/_pico/biosnds7.rom`.

Note that Pico Loader can currently not run retail roms from the DSi SD card. Homebrew is supported, however.

Retail games support an in-game hotkey to return to the launcher when `launcherPath` is set by the application that booted Pico Loader. The default hotkey is `L + R + START + SELECT`. When triggered, Pico Loader writes a `.state.bin` snapshot that currently contains ARM9/ARM7 CPU context blocks, main RAM, shared WRAM, ARM7 WRAM, VRAM, palette RAM, OAM, a staged ARM9 ITCM image, and partial ARM9/ARM7 IO snapshots including display, timers, DMA, ARM9 TCM control, and ARM7 audio registers before returning to the launcher. Launchers can then resume that dump by passing `__pico_state=<path>` in the arguments buffer when starting the same ROM again. New snapshots are written atomically through a temp file and now embed ROM identity metadata so loader-side resume can reject mismatched states. This is still not a fully exact savestate yet: ARM9 DTCM contents, full IRQ/MMIO coverage, and fully verified end-to-end resume behavior still need more work.

## Supported platforms

> [!CAUTION]
> Using the wrong platform could damage your flashcard!

Note that there can be some game compatibility differences between different platforms.

The DMA column indicates whether DMA card reads are implemented for the platform . Without DMA card reads, some games can have cache related issues.<br>
Note that there are still SDK versions and variants for which Pico Loader does not yet support DMA card reads.

## Setup & Configuration
We recommend using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), or MSYS2 to compile this repository.
The steps provided will assume you already have one of those environments set up.

1. Install [BlocksDS](https://blocksds.skylyrac.net/docs/setup/)
2. Install [.NET 9.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-install?tabs=dotnet9&pivots=os-linux-ubuntu-2404) for your system (note: this link points to the instructions for Ubuntu, but links for most OS'es are available on the same page)

## Cloning
This repository includes submodules. Make sure to clone it recursively:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LNH-team/pico-loader.git
```

If you cloned without initializing submodules, run the following command:
```
git submodule update --init
```

## Compiling
1. Run `make`
    - By default this compiles for the DSpico platform. To specify a different platform use `make PICO_PLATFORM=PLATFORM`, for example `make PICO_PLATFORM=R4`. See the table above for the supported platforms.
2. To use Pico Loader, create a `_pico` folder in the root of your flashcard SD card and copy the following files to it:
    - `picoLoader7.bin`
    - `picoLoader9.bin` (the version for your platform)
    - `aplist.bin` (generated in the `data` folder of the repo)
    - `savelist.bin` (generated in the `data` folder of the repo)
    - `patchlist.bin` (generated in the `data` folder of the repo)

## Emunand
When running DSiWare and DSi system apps, Pico Loader redirects NAND to the flashcard SD card. This requires the following files and folders, obtained from a DSi/3DS nand, and a DS (**not DSi**) ARM7 BIOS dump, in the root of your flashcard SD card:
- `_pico`
    - `biosnds7.rom`
- `photo` - The photo partition of nand will be redirected to this folder
- `shared1`
- `shared2`
    - `0000`
- `sys`
    - `TWLFontTable.dat`

## How to use Pico Loader from homebrew
On the arm9:
1. Map VRAM blocks A, B, C and D to LCDC
2. Load `picoLoader9.bin` to `0x06800000` (VRAM A and B)
3. Load `picoLoader7.bin` to `0x06840000` (VRAM C and D)
4. Setup the header of picoLoader7 to specify what should be loaded. See `pload_header7_t` in [include/picoLoader7.h](include/picoLoader7.h).
   - If `v2.launcherPath` is set, homebrew gets the bootstub return-to-launcher support and retail games get the in-game hotkey return-to-launcher support.
    - Caution: VRAM does not support byte writes!
5. Disable irqs and dma
6. Ensure the cache is flushed
7. Map VRAM C and D to arm7
8. Request the arm7 to boot into picoLoader7
    - Arm7: Disable sound, irqs and dma and jump to the `entryPoint` specified in the picoLoader7 header. Note that after mapping the VRAM to arm7, it appears at `0x06000000` on the arm7 side.
9. Arm9 jump to `0x06800000`

Note that vram must be executable on the arm9.
